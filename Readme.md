Entities 
1- PLANE_TYPE
2- AIRPLANE
3- HANGAR
4- OWNER (GENERALIZED CLASS)
5- CORPORATION (SUB-CLASS OF OWNER)
6- PERSON (SUB-CLASS OF OWNER, AND ALSO SUPER CLASS (SPECIALIZATION))
7- PILOT(SUB-CLASS OF PERSON)
8- EMPLOYEE (SUB-CLASS OF PERSON)
9- SERVICE(WEAK-ENTITY, DEPENDENT OF AIRPLANE)
10- FOUR MANY-MANY RELATIONSHIPS
A- PLANE_TYPE TO PILOT
B- PLANE_TYPE TO EMPLOYEE
C- SERVICE TO EMPLOYEE
D- AIRPLANE TO OWNER
11- THREE ONE-MANY RELATIONSHIPS
A- PLANE_TYPE TO AIRPLANE
B- HANGAR TO AIRPLANE
C- AIRPLANE TO SERVICE
### EXPLANATION
At the center of the diagram is the AIRPLANE entity, which is connected to the PLANE_TYPE and HANGAR entities via the P_MODEL and P_HANGAR foreign keys, respectively. The OWNERS entity is related to AIRPLANE via the OWNS relation, which tracks ownership history.

The CORPORATION and PERSON entities are related to OWNERS, as corporations and individuals may both be owners.

The PILOT entity is related to the PERSON entity via the SSN foreign key, and to the PLANE_TYPE entity via the FLIES relation, which tracks which pilots are qualified to fly which plane types.

The EMPLOYEE entity is also related to PERSON via the SSN foreign key, and to PLANE_TYPE via the WORKS_ON relation, which tracks which employees are assigned to work on which planes.

Finally, the SERVICE_DETAILS entity is related to AIRPLANE via the REG_NO foreign key, and to the MAINTAIN entity via the WORKCODE and REG_NO foreign keys, which track which employees performed which maintenance work on each airplane.

Overall, the EERD provides a clear visual representation of the relationships between the entities in the database schema, allowing for easy understanding and maintenance of the system.
